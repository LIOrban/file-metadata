# File Metadata Microservice 
## FreeCodeCamp Full Stack Project


Objective: Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: https://aryanj-file-size.herokuapp.com/ and deploy it to Heroku.

Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:

User Story: I can submit a FormData object that includes a file upload.

User Story: When I submit something, I will receive the file size in bytes within the **JSON response** (not HTML)

Hint: You may want to use this package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer
